.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

basketball-bund.net provides tables, resulds, playing schedules and statistics for every league. But by default there is no way to display these data at your own website.

This extension tries to provide a solution, and imports the requested data to your TYPO3 CMS.

The first plugin "basketball-bund.net - Team" just imports the selected data (table, results, playing schedule or statistics) and displays them as configurable table.

The seconde plugin "basketball-bund.net - Teamcollection" fetches the last match-result of the teams in the collection an displays them in only one table. Ideal as an overview at your startpage.
